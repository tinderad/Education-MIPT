I know there was a time where once I
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yackidy-yac
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
MC's get taken to school with this music
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
It's actually disastrously bad
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
And take a vacation to trip a broad
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
You were just what the doctor ordered
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
For good at least once in a while
Roll Hall of Fame
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
Angels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
One when I tried to say "I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
I don't know what words to use
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
I'mma work for everything I have
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
You write normal, fuck being normal
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
It's me, my honesty's brutal
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Oh, he's too mainstream
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Don't mistake it for Satan
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
And I should not be woken
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
And understand the discrimination
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
Singin' to a man while they played piano
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
You get too big and here they come trying to
How many verses I gotta murder to
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You witnessing a mass occur
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
Now I lead a new school full of students
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
I don't know how to make songs like that
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
I got a laptop in my back pocket
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
Made a living and a killing off it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
I'm an MC still as honest
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
School flunkie, pill junky
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
To keep up with the same pace looking boy
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
And a "way to go" from your label everyday looking boy
Little gay looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
Full of myself, but still hungry
