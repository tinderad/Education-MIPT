All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
And I should not be woken
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
And a "way to go" from your label everyday looking boy
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And understand the discrimination
Angels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me
Appeal with the skin color of mine
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned
But I got your mom deep throating
But I'm only going to get this one chance
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Don't mistake it for Satan
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
For good at least once in a while
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as
Full of myself, but still hungry
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
How many verses I gotta murder to
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I got a laptop in my back pocket
I know there was a time where once I
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
I'm an MC still as honest
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
I'mma work for everything I have
I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
It's actually disastrously bad
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
It's me, my honesty's brutal
It's not hip hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
Let me know when it occurs to you
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Little gay looking boy
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
MC's get taken to school with this music
Made a living and a killing off it
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
Now I lead a new school full of students
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Oh, he's too mainstream
One when I tried to say "I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
On the wall of shame
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yackidy-yac
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
Roll Hall of Fame
School flunkie, pill junky
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Singin' to a man while they played piano
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
To keep up with the same pace looking boy
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
With rock, shock rap with Doc
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
You get too big and here they come trying to
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
You were just what the doctor ordered
You witnessing a mass occur
You write normal, fuck being normal
